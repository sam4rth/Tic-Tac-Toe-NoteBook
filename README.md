# Tic-Tac-Toe-NoteBook
Tic-Tac-Toe Notebook is a simple Android Game, made in android studio, using Java as the main language. The game has 2 player mode and single player mode where an AI made using a simple minimax algorithm compitite with the human player. And it has difficulty levels, with a decent UI. It took me a bit more than 30 hours to make this game, lerning minimax and some simple android featurs included. You can find the game on playstore here...
