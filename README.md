## Tic-Tac-Toe Notebook

**Tic-Tac-Toe Notebook** is a simple Android game built using **Java** in **Android Studio**. It features:

* Two-player mode
* Single-player mode with an AI opponent based on the **Minimax algorithm**
* Adjustable difficulty levels
* A functional, beginner-friendly UI

This project took me a bit over 30 hours, during which I learned the **Minimax algorithm** and several core Android development concepts.

## What You Can Do with This

Feel free to:

* Fork it, improve the UI, and make your own version
* Use it as a starting point for your Android development journey
* Study the Minimax implementation for a simple game AI

While the UI isn't the best, the logic is solid, and there's plenty of room to expand!
